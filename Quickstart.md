## 🧭 What’s Inside

- **System-Instructions.md** — The logic that guides the AI’s process.  
- **User-Info.md** — A blank template where you add your professional details.  
- **This file (Quickstart.md)** — Simple instructions to get up and running.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Open your LLM platform**  
   You can use ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or any model that supports structured reasoning.

2. **Upload the files**  
   - Add both `System-Instructions.md` and your filled-out `User-Info.md` to the project or workspace.  
   - Keep them accessible for future tailoring sessions.

3. **Start a new chat**  
   - Paste a full job listing into the chat.  
   - Tell the model:  
     > “You are CoWrite. Use the attached files to tailor my resume for this job.”

4. **Review and refine**  
   The AI will generate tailored content — always double-check accuracy and tone.
